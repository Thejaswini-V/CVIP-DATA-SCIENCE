House Price Prediction
This repository contains code for a house price prediction project. The purpose of this project is to develop a model that can predict the prices of houses based on certain features or variables.

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code: python house_price_prediction.py
Usage
In the house_price_prediction.py file, you'll find the main code for the house price prediction. Modify the code as needed, such as preprocessing the data, training the model, or testing the predictions. Feel free to customize the code to suit your specific requirements.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is  included in the repository. However, you can find the dataset we used for training and testing the model in the Kaggle. If you wish to use your own dataset, make sure it is in the appropriate format and update the code accordingly.

Analysis Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. This step involves examining data statistics, visualizing distributions, detecting outliers, and identifying potential correlations between features and the target variable.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for training the prediction model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing any necessary feature engineering.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that have the most significant impact on the target variable. This step helps reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Select suitable machine learning algorithms for house price prediction and train them using the preprocessed dataset. Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared. Compare the performance of different models to choose the best one.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the selected model by adjusting its hyperparameters using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. This step aims to optimize the model's performance and generalization capability.

Model Deployment: Once you have a trained and optimized model, you can deploy it in a production environment. This may involve creating a web API, building a user interface, or integrating the model into an existing application.

Models
In this project, we experimented with multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. You can find the implementations of these models in the models/ directory. Feel free to explore and experiment with different models to improve the predictions.
